Rain drops... Lifts ignorance

Some weeks back, I was with a friend at Sankey. It started raining after a while and as I was observing the scene, a beautiful analogy presented itself before me.

There were ripples on the lake. And I thought to myself what is the cause? While we say it is the rain that causes the ripples, it is in fact the nature of the lake that causes the ripples. Raindrops fall all over, yet ripples are formed only on the water surface. In effect the cause of ripples is not the raindrops but rather the nature of  the surface where ripples are formed.

Similarly as we go through life, we would like to blame various people and/or situations for our actions/inaction, while it is in fact our own nature, our personalities that determine how we react to people/situations.
